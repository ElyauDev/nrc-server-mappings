# Image Conventions for Server Assets

This document describes the conventions for images used in server manifests, specifically for `icon` and `background` assets.

## 1. File Naming
- **icon**: The icon image should be named `icon.png`.
- **background**: The background image should be named `bg.png` in the server source directory, and will be renamed to `background.png` in the merged output.

## 2. File Format
- All images must be in **PNG** format (`.png`).
- Use lossless compression to preserve quality.

## 3. Dimensions
- **icon.png**: Recommended size is **64x64** - **512x512** pixels. Must be square.
- **bg.png**: Size is **1920x1080** pixels.

## 4. Transparency
- **icon.png**: Supports transparency. Use transparent backgrounds where appropriate.
- **bg.png**: Should be fully opaque.

## 5. Usage in Manifest
- In each server's `manifest.json`, reference images as:
  ```json
  "assets": {
    "icon": "./icon.png",
    "background": "./bg.png"
  }
  ```
- The merge script will copy and rename these to the merged output as `icon.png` and `background.png` under `merged/assets/<server>/`.

## 6. Quality
- Avoid visible compression artifacts.
- Use clear, high-contrast images for icons.
- Backgrounds should not contain text or logos that may be obscured by overlays.
